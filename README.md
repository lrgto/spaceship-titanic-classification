<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### Introduction

Machine Learning Python for detecting whether passengers are transported or not using tensor flow decision tress. Improved python code and accuracy from source code.

#### Description

Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. We've received a transmission from four lightyears away and things aren't looking good.

The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.

While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!

To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.

Help save them and change history!

#### Evaluation

Metric

Submissions are evaluated based on their classification accuracy, the percentage of predicted labels that are correct.

Submission Format

The submission format for the competition is a csv file with the following format:

PassengerId,Transported
0013_01,False
0018_01,False
0019_01,False
0021_01,False
etc.

### Built With

`Python` `Jupyter Notebooks` `Matplotlib` `Numpy` `Tensorflow` `Pandas` `Seaborn`

<!-- USAGE -->

## Usage

One account per participant

You cannot sign up to Kaggle from multiple accounts and therefore you cannot submit from multiple accounts.

No private sharing outside teams

Privately sharing code or data outside of teams is not permitted. It's okay to share code if made available to all participants on the forums.

Team Mergers

Team mergers are allowed and can be performed by the team leader. In order to merge, the combined team must have a total submission count less than or equal to the maximum allowed as of the Team Merger Deadline. The maximum allowed is the number of submissions per day multiplied by the number of days the competition has been running.

Team Limits

The maximum team size is 10.

Submission Limits

You may submit a maximum of 10 entries per day.

Final submissions selection is not relevant for Getting Started competitions.
